The storyboard is managed on [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io). They have great documentation on how to use the website [here](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/205625009-Getting-Started-with-Clubhouse). The players story can be found in the completed state and shows an example of the task breakdown.

To get started on a story assign yourself to it on clubhouse and follow the procedure below:
1. Ensure it is not blocked by any other stories, if that's the case then follow the blockages until you find a story ready to develop.
2. Create a your own branch from the master branch on github, follow naming pattern of add-<feature>.
3. If necessary update the class diagram found on the google drive shared folder.
4. Implement your solution(if you take more than one session remember to keep committing code to your branch).
5. Create javadoc for your code, an example of the format to use can be found in the player class.
6. Create corresponding JUnit files in the test package (the structure is mirrored). Ensure the tests cover your code and all pass. Again an example of this can be found for the player class.
7. If you believe the addition is ready for deployment then make a pull request and assign someone to review your code and move the story to the 'ready for review' state on clubhouse. If the assignee comes back with required changes complete those and request review again.
8. When the merge is complete move the story to 'completed' state on clubhouse.
